INTRODUCTION                                    *rake*

This plugin is designed to let you use your favorite rails.vim commands in a
plain old Ruby project.

Projects are detected by searching for a Rakefile up the directory hierarchy.
Projects without a Rakefile will also be detected if they sit inside
$GEM_PATH, making this plugin ideal for "gem open" or "bundle open".

COMMANDS                                        *rake-commands*

                                                *rake-:Rake*
:Rake [task]            Invoke |:make| followed by |:cwindow| with rake as the
                        'makeprg'.  Uses `bundle exec rake` if bundler.vim is
                        installed and active for the current project.

                                                *rake-:Rcd*
:Rcd [directory]        |:cd| relative to the project.

                                                *rake-:Rlcd*
:Rlcd [directory]       |:lcd| relative to the project.

                                                *rake-:R*
:R [file]               With no argument, edits the "related" file (the test
                        for an implementation file and vice versa).  With an
                        argument, edit that file, relative to the Gem's root.

                                                *rake-:RS*
:RS [file]              Like |:R|, but horizontally split.

                                                *rake-:RV*
:RV [file]              Like |:R|, but vertically split.

                                                *rake-:RT*
:RT [file]              Like |:R|, but use a new tab.

                                                *rake-:RD*
:RD [file]              Like |:R|, but :read the file in.

                        *rake-:A* *rake-:AS* *rake-:AV* *rake-:AT* *rake-:AD*
:A                      Unlike in rails.vim, these are identical to their :R
:AS                     counterparts.
:AV
:AT
:AD

                                                *rake-:Rlib*
:Rlib [file]            Edit a Ruby file under lib/, or Gemfile if no argument
                        is given.  Variants exist for :RSlib, :RVlib, :RTlib,
                        and :RDlib.

                                                *rake-:Rtest*
:Rtest [file]           Edit a test file under test/ or a spec file under
                        spec/.  Defaults to the test helper or spec helper.
                        Has the same variants as |:Rlib|.

                                                *rake-:Rspec*
:Rspec [file]           Edit a spec file under spec/ or a test file under
                        test/.  Defaults to the spec helper or test helper.
                        Has the same variants as |:Rlib|.  The only difference
                        between this command and |:Rtest| is which gets
                        precedence when both files exist.

                                                *rake-:Rtask*
:Rtask [file]           Edit a .rake file under rakelib/, or Rakefile if no
                        argument is given.  Has the same variants as |:Rlib|.

                                               *rake-:Rtags*
:Rtags                  Invoke ctags for the project.  Ordinarily it will
                        place the resulting tags file in the root of the
                        project, but if the directory is read only (e.g., a
                        system gem), it will be placed in a temp file instead.
